# EduHire Application Beta.

Candidates get to learn while they apply for jobs. Companies can vet their employees pre-interview.

## Idea 

Hiring is inefficient for both the employer and applicants. Most applicants have been able to perfect the traditional job application with a perfect resume, cover letter and more. It is extremely difficult to differenciate between employees meaning that employers are more likely to skip over the candidates that they want, and candidates are not getting the attention they deserve.

EduHire solves this by providing employers with a stronger application process for employees, meaning that the candidate pool is smaller, but more talented. Candidates are able to better showcase their skills, while having a higher chance of getting hired given that they put effort into the application process while having the additional benefit of learning along the way.

We are able to do this by not focusing on traditional hiring metrics such as resume, writing and interviews, but instead on research and projects -- physical work that candidates complete.

Employers create their job application around a 30 minute research question and 1 hour project that the candidate must complete to the best of their ability in order to apply for the job.
